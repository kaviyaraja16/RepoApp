Repo App
I have created a simple repository app as given in the assignment

#TO RUN THE APP IN LOCAL
1. Open Two terminals
2. In first terminal, change directory to the folder 
3. "ng serve" to serve the website
4. In second terminal,change directory to the same folder
5. "npm run json:server" to run the server which contains the server database for repository list.
Note: You won't be able to see the complete website if you did not run both terminals simutaneously

#Components
I have created three components- Loader,Repository,Navbar and a angular service- repository list service.All the components are embeded in app.component.html
